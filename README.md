## Struct of Code

- `encoder.py`: LTEncoder to generate encoded data blocks. See [this repo](https://github.com/Dafeigy/LTCode-py.git) for details.
- `aaaa.py`: Nothing but some script that helps gen some static information.

- `sampler`: dependencies for `encoder.py`. Robust Soliton Distribution is hereby implemented.

- `test.py`: Maybe later will use Vue+FastAPI instead of Flask only.
